## AI Transformations for Sustainability

Throughout history, societal
transformations have been
driven by the emergence of
general-purpose technologies
that reshaped entire economies,
industries, and ways of life.

The steam engine, the printing press, electricity, and the
internet have each marked pivotal social and economic
shifts, leading to lasting changes to how we live and
work. Today, Al stands as the latest-and potentially
most powerful-general-purpose technology, offering
an unprecedented opportunity to drive the societal
transformations we urgently need to achieve the world's
sustainability goals.

In 2023, we published Accelerating Sustainability with
AI: A Playbook, in which we highlighted that AI has three
game-changing capabilities that make it an essential tool
for accelerating sustainability. AI can enhance our ability
to predict and optimize complex systems, accelerate the
development and deployment of sustainable solutions,
and empower the workforce to learn and achieve more-
equipping society with the means to drive sustainability
progress at a speed and scale previously beyond reach.

<!-- PageHeader="Looking ahead" -->

Over the last year, we have seen the potential of AI for
sustainability in action, empowering the world with new tools
for tackling the climate crisis and sustainability challenges more
broadly. For example, earlier this year, Microsoft collaborated with
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory to use AI in discovering
a new battery material requiring less lithium-a breakthrough
achieved in weeks rather than the years that traditional research
and development would have required. Reducing lithium
dependence is crucial to decarbonization as global demand for
lithium is projected to outpace supply, potentially limiting the
growth of the energy storage systems needed for the shift to
electrification and renewable energy.1

Al's transformative capabilities extend far beyond sustainability,
the world has an opportunity to harness AI to enhance both
productivity and prosperity. By enabling smarter resource use,
optimizing systems for efficiency, and fostering innovations
in carbon-free energy and conservation, the AI economy also
has the potential to advance both economic growth with
environmental stewardship.

At Microsoft, we believe the world needs AI that is broadly
accessible and trustworthy, this also includes addressing the
sustainability challenges associated with this technology.
The five plays outlined in our AI and sustainability playbook
reflect the targeted actions needed to unlock full potential
of AI for accelerating sustainability progress globally.

Across our sustainability work, we regularly assess our progress
and adjust our strategies for greater impact. One lesson from
this last year, is that minimizing the sustainability impact of
AI operations requires more than minimizing resource use
in datacenter operations; it also requires supporting the
communities where datacenters are located and expanding
access to zero-carbon electricity. Global electricity demand is
growing rapidly, at an estimated average annual rate of 3-4%.2
While AI currently consumes less than 0.3% of global electricity
demand-and, according to the International Energy Agency
(IEA), is expected to remain a small portion in the decade
ahead-rapid growth in certain regions can strain local grids.2

In light of these realities, we have updated the third play
of our playbook to include enhancing access to carbon-free
energy on electricity grids and supporting local communities
where we operate datacenters. In support of these goals,
we are expanding our effort to build and operate digital
infrastructure that addresses societal challenges and
creates benefits for communities.

This report highlights Microsoft's innovations and actions to
advance each of the five plays. Examples of our efforts across
the five plays include:


#### Play 1


##### Invest in AI for sustainability

Microsoft is investing in building AI tools, such as MatterGen3
and MatterSim4, to enable researchers to design and test
materials with ten-fold greater accuracy and vastly faster
performance, and in AI foundation models such as Aurora,
which predicts global weather and atmospheric processes with
increased accuracy and at speeds up to 5,000 times greater than
current forecasting systems5 . We are also building AI-enabled
tools to empower stakeholders to more effectively and efficiently
manage agriculture and water resources and to expedite
licensing process for carbon-free electricity.


##### Play 2


###### Develop digital and data infrastructure for the inclusive use of AI for sustainability

We are creating tools to fill critical data gaps, which can enhance
AI models for better measuring and predicting complex systems
such as biodiversity and climate. For instance, SPARROW captures
images and acoustic recordings to gather data on biodiversity and
ecosystem health in remote areas.6 Additionally, we are partnering
with G42 on a $1 billion digital ecosystem initiative in Kenya.7


##### Play 3


###### Minimize resource use, expand access to carbon-free electricity, and support local communities

Microsoft is innovating datacenter development with low-carbon
materials like cross-laminated timber.8 Through an agreement
with Brookfield, we aim to add 10.5 gigawatts (GW) of renewable
energy to the grid.9


### 10.5 GW

of new renewable energy capacity to be developed
across the United States and Europe.


#### Play 4 Advance AI policy principles and governance for sustainability

We advocated for policies that accelerate grid decarbonization
including Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)
transmission rules and provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act
in the United States. In addition, we continue to advance AI
governance within Microsoft and globally.


#### Play 5


##### Build workforce capacity to use AI for sustainability

Microsoft Philanthropies' Skills for Social Impact program
trained over 14 million people in digital and AI skills to support
a workforce ready to deploy AI for sustainability.10

As the window for achieving global sustainability goals narrows,
the urgency for action intensifies. The world needs every tool
at its disposal, and the potential of AI to accelerate sustainability
is already being realized. Sustainability is not a journey that can
be taken alone and unlocking the full potential of AI for climate
progress requires continued partnerships to combine expertise,
technology, and innovation. As we continue to explore the
ways AI can advance sustainability, we invite others to join
us in this journey.

In 2023, Microsoft released our
Accelerating Sustainability with AI
playbook, where we highlighted
that AI has three game-changing
capabilities that are essential for
accelerating sustainability, and
outlined five plays that represent the
necessary conditions for the world to
be able to unlock them. This paper
reports on our progress in each of
the five plays and provides updates
based on lessons learned.


## Why AI is essential for sustainability: Three capabilities

Achieving global sustainability goals requires transformative
progress at an unprecedented pace and scale. To meet these
ambitions, scientists project that the world must triple carbon-free
energy capacity2, double energy efficiency by 20302, and reverse
biodiversity loss to achieve a nature-positive future. However,
progress is constrained by three key hurdles. First, many of
the challenges of sustainability-such as managing energy
grids, improving resource use, and protecting ecosystems-
have grown too complex for traditional tools and approaches.
Second, innovation often moves too slowly, as conventional
research and development processes are time-consuming
and costly. Third, there is a significant workforce gap, with too
few people equipped with the tools and knowledge needed
to advance sustainability solutions.

<!-- PageHeader="AI Investments" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Data & Infrastructure" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Energy & Resources" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Policy & Governance" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Workforce capacity" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Looking ahead" -->


## AI is essential for overcoming these hurdles because it brings three game-changing capabilities:


### 1


#### Measure, predict, and optimize complex systems

AI enables the analysis, modeling, and optimization of
challenges like energy distribution, resource allocation,
and environmental monitoring.


### 2


#### Accelerate the development of sustainability solutions

AI reduces the time and cost of innovation
by rapidly analyzing data, predicting outcomes,
and optimizing solutions.

3


#### Empower the sustainability workforce

AI enhances productivity by automating repetitive tasks,
providing actionable insights, and making advanced tools
accessible to more people.

These capabilities make AI a critical enabler of sustainability
progress. By addressing complexity, speeding up innovation,
and empowering people, AI helps deliver the scale and speed
needed to achieve a sustainable future.


#### How to unlock Al's full potential: Five Plays

While AI is already being applied in transformative ways to
measure and optimize complex systems, accelerate sustainability
solutions, and empower the workforce, these game-changing
capabilities can only be fully realized if key enabling conditions
are in place. As outlined in our AI and sustainability playbook,
achieving these conditions requires action across five strategies or
"plays". Each play identifies the steps needed to lay the foundation
for AI to deliver transformative impact on sustainability.


#### Play 1 The world must invest in AI to accelerate sustainability solutions

Without focused investments, Al's abilities to accelerate
sustainability will remain underdeveloped and underutilized.
AI cannot be a game-changer unless resources are directed
to develop and deploy solutions that tackle challenges like
decarbonization, water management, and biodiversity restoration.


#### Play 2 It is vital to develop digital and data infrastructure for the inclusive use of AI for sustainability

AI models rely on high-quality representative data and the
infrastructure to process it. Without these, AI technologies will
not realize the full potential of their game-changing capabilities
for sustainability because the insights AI models generate will be
limited, inaccurate, or biased, undermining their effectiveness.


#### Play 3


##### It is essential to minimize resource use in AI infrastructure design and operation, expand access to carbon-free energy, and support local communities

AI has its own energy and water demands, so minimizing resource
use and ensuring that AI systems are powered by carbon-free
energy is critical to scaling its use sustainably. In addition, because
AI infrastructure is concentrated in certain regions, it is essential to
support local communities where datacenters are located.


##### Play 4 AI policy principles and governance for sustainability must be advanced

Strong policies and governance are critical for accelerating
decarbonizing the energy system, as well as incentivizing
and guiding the proper use of AI for sustainability solutions.
Without clear policies, the power of Al's three game-changing
capabilities could be undermined by unintended consequences
or inequitable deployment.


### Play 5


#### The workforce capacity to use AI for sustainability must be built

Even the most advanced AI tools depend on people who can
apply them effectively. Bridging the sustainability workforce gap
requires investment in training, skills development, and capacity-
building programs to ensure that AI game-changing capabilities
can be broadly used.

AI is already making important contributions to accelerating
sustainability progress, demonstrating its ability to deliver the
speed, scale, and solutions needed to tackle urgent environmental
challenges. However, more is needed. If action is taken across
these five plays, the world can create the necessary conditions for
Al to fully unlock its game-changing capabilities-equitably and
responsibly-and further amplify its impact in building a more
sustainable future.

## Accelerating Sustainability with AI


## Play 1: Invest in AI for sustainability

In this section, we highlight examples
of investments being made to develop
tools and apply AI for each of its
three game-changing capabilities:
measuring and optimizing complex
systems, accelerating sustainability
solutions, and empowering the
workforce. These AI capabilities are
already being applied across a range
of sectors from energy to biodiversity
and climate risk.

Following, we share some examples
of how Microsoft is collaborating with
various partners to apply Al's three
game-changing capabilities in two
areas: the net-zero energy transition
and climate risk management.


### 7 Investing in AI to measure, predict, and optimize complex systems

Al's ability to analyze vast amounts of data, identify patterns,
and make real-time predictions enables it to optimize complex
systems that are central to sustainability, such as electricity grids
and supply chains, while helping to transform understanding
and management of biodiversity challenges and climate risks.
The following examples showcase how Al's first game-changing
capability-the ability to measure, predict, and optimize complex
systems-is driving efficiencies and improving outcomes for
people and the planet.


#### Net-zero energy transition

AI is already accelerating the path to net-zero energy by helping
to integrate renewable energy sources like solar and wind into
electricity grids and overcome challenges in balancing variable
supply with demand, as well as enhancing grid efficiency and
resilience. Organizations worldwide are using AI to accelerate
progress. The US Department of Energy (DOE) is investing in AI
to accelerate clean energy deployment, secure grid infrastructure,
and reduce the costs of next-generation energy technologies-
key steps in achieving a net-zero energy system.11

Microsoft is making similar investments in AI to help accelerate
the net-zero energy transition. In 2024, the National Grid in
western New York worked with LineVision, a company that
Microsoft has invested in, to install the largest fully integrated
operationalization of dynamic line ratings in the United States.
LineRate, LineVision's Al-driven software with sensor validation,
was deployed on four 115-kilovolt transmission lines in a
renewable energy-rich region of New York state.12

<!-- PageFooter="Accelerating Sustainability with AI: Innovations for a Better Future" -->
<!-- PageNumber="8" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="Foreword" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Actions & Innovations" -->
<!-- PageHeader="AI Investments" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Data & Infrastructure" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Energy & Resources Policy & Governance" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Workforce capacity" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Looking ahead" -->

This technology has been deployed around the world, providing
predictive maintenance and load forecasting that has been
designed to enhance reliability and efficiency. In some regions,
it increased transmission capacity up to 60%.12 Increased capacity
in New York is highly correlated with increased renewable power
transmitted over these lines.

We are also working directly with renewable energy companies,
to optimize energy production. For example, by utilizing
reinforcement learning and Microsoft Azure high-performance
computing (HPC), Energy companies are optimizing wind farm
performance, predicting maintenance needs, and enhancing
energy production efficiency and reliability.13

In addition to renewable integration, Microsoft is collaborating
with organizations around the world to develop and deploy
AI-enabled tools to reduce methane emissions,14 a powerful
greenhouse gas, from a variety of sources, including the
energy, agriculture, and waste sectors.15,16 For example, in 2023,
the Global FoodBanking Network (GFN) started developing
the Food Recovery to Avoid Methane Emissions (FRAME)
methodology to measure and track the methane emissions
prevented by food recovery efforts in food banks within its
network, covering 63 organizations in 53 countries.17 GFN used
Microsoft Sustainability Manager as a key tool for building a
custom emissions dashboard.

This dashboard was piloted with food banks in Mexico and
Ecuador to provide a clear, real-time view of their environmental
impact and alignment with the United Nations (UN) Sustainable
Development Goals.17 The built-in guidelines, carbon activities
settings, and standardized factors within Microsoft Sustainability
Manager streamlined processes, enhanced precision and ease
in use. GFN plans to expand the methane mitigation project
in other parts of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa and
Southeast Asia, to help food banks that recover and redistribute
surplus food demonstrate the impact of their actions to reduce
methane emissions.


#### Climate risk management

Climate change has altered weather patterns and led to new
extremes in 2024. Record heat, in excess of 46℃ (115°F), closed
schools, devastated crops, and killed hundreds of people across
Asia.18 Heavy precipitation and flooding in Kenya and Brazil
displaced over 200,000 people.19 Managing and mitigating these
growing climate risks is difficult, in part due to the challenges of
predicting weather and assessing vulnerabilities.20 AI is starting to
change this. Governments, businesses, and organizations globally
are investing in AI to manage climate risks, from predicting
extreme weather to developing resilient crops and workforce
copilots. For instance, the UN's Global Initiative on Resilience
to Natural Hazards21 and the US Department of Homeland
Security22 are using AI to enhance disaster preparedness
and community resilience.


### INNOVATION SPOTLIGHT

Utilidata
Improving energy
transmission and
grid capacity

Through the Microsoft Climate
Innovation Fund, Microsoft invested
in Utilidata, which brings AI to the
electric grid, transforming the way
utilities operate. Utilidata's distributed
AI platform, Karman, identifies, classifies,
and predicts grid conditions, enabling
the management of distributed
energy resources in real time.

<!-- PageHeader="Energy & Resources Policy & Governance" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Workforce capacity" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Looking ahead" -->

Microsoft is also investing in AI to increase the efficiency
and effectiveness of climate risk management. AI is enhancing
weather predictions by analyzing vast amounts of data from
diverse sources, including satellite imagery, weather stations, and
ocean buoys. AI-powered models can identify complex patterns
and relationships within this data that traditional statistical
methods might overlook, resulting in more accurate and granular
predictions of extreme weather events. Additionally, AI enhances
scientists' ability to refine predictions and explore trends related
to climate change by complementing physical models with
data-driven insights. This integration enables more informed
projections about future climate trends while supporting the
ongoing study of climate dynamics. Microsoft Research's Al for
Science team developed an AI foundation model, Aurora, that
predicts weather with unprecedented accuracy using 1.3 billion
parameters to forecast global weather patterns and atmospheric
processes like air pollution.5 Aurora was trained on more than
1 million hours of weather and climate simulations, which allows it
to understand complex atmospheric dynamics.5 The model excels
at a wide range of prediction tasks, even in data-sparse regions or
for extreme weather scenarios, operating at approximately 5,000
times the rate of the most state-of-the-art integrated forecasting
system that weather services currently employ.5

But to manage and mitigate climate risks, the world needs
more than weather predictions. Climate risks arise from
multiple characteristics of both natural and built environments.
To effectively manage climate risks, solutions are needed to
integrate multiple information sources to assess vulnerabilities
to hazards and target rapid response across various systems
in different locations. The Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund
invested in Mitiga, a company that uses AI, high-performance
computing, and cutting-edge climate models to predict the
impact of physical climate change on any asset, anywhere in the
world, from now until the century's end-within seconds. Mitiga's
EarthScan platform enables infrastructure, commercial real estate,
insurers, and companies across industries to manage risks and
comply with climate disclosure regulations.23 Microsoft's Al for
Good Lab has collaborated with Planet Labs PBC, combining the
power of AI with satellite imagery to help emergency responders
and local authorities rapidly assess the extent of damage to
buildings after disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and wildfires,
and helping them better target efforts to deliver critical aid.24

Wildfire is a growing climate risk, causing devastation across
the globe. In 2024, record-sized wildfires broke out in Canada,
Greece, and the Amazon, while fast-moving wildfires in Hawaii
and Chile killed hundreds of people.25 Climate change is drying
out landscapes with historically low burn rates, making them
more flammable.26 The risk of wildfires arises from a complex
interplay of weather, vegetation, and land and water management
practices.25 Companies like Vibrant Planet are using AI to better
predict and manage these risks.27


#### Biodiversity protection

The UN estimates that over 1 million species are now at risk from
extinction, many within the next decade.28 Tackling biodiversity
loss requires monitoring and managing complex systems that
are interconnected across the globe. AI is emerging as a game-
changer in improving understanding and tracking changes
and empowering conservation practitioners.29-31 Microsoft has
deployed AI-enabled technologies in the Amazon rainforest,
which are far more effective than traditional biodiversity
monitoring approaches. Project Guacamaya is an innovative
partnership between Microsoft's Al for Good Lab, Planet Labs
PBC, Instituto Sinchi, Universidad de los Andes, and the Alexander
von Humboldt Institute in Colombia that uses a combination of
camera trap footage and bioacoustics to identify species and
track their recovery or loss in the Amazon rainforest.32 Project
Guacamaya's open-source algorithms help scientists to identify
species in over 110,000 camera trap images with 90% accuracy,
detecting not only native but non-native species indicative of
ecosystem health.32 These tools cut analyses from months to
minutes.30 In combination with high-resolution satellite data,
they allow conservation practitioners to monitor and manage
the critically important Amazon rainforest, which contains
a large percentage of remaining biodiversity and plays an
important role in regulating regional and global climate.33

### 2 Investing in AI to accelerate the development of sustainability solutions

Many sustainability solutions are slowed by time-intensive and
costly research and development processes. But AI is transforming
the speed and scale of innovation by rapidly analyzing complex
data, quickly identifying potential optimal solutions, and
automating processes that previously required significant time
and resources. Organizations around the world are already
investing in putting this second AI game-changing capability
to work. For example, AI is starting to be used by organizations
around the world to accelerate the discovery of new materials
for low-carbon manufacturing34 and the identification of crop
varieties resilient to a changing climate,35 and to design advanced
energy catalysts to improve the efficiency of clean energy
technologies.36 Following are a few examples of how Microsoft is
investing in Al's second game-changing capability to accelerate
the development of sustainability solutions, drawing from two
sectors: net-zero energy transition and climate risk management.


### Net-zero energy transition

Organizations are using AI to accelerate research and
development, demonstrating its transformative potential for
advancing the net-zero energy transition. Advanced algorithms,
machine learning, and vast datasets are enabling breakthroughs
that were previously unimaginable.

The Microsoft AI for Science initiative focuses on applying
advanced AI capabilities to accelerate scientific discovery
and address some of humanity's most pressing challenges.
Using deep learning and machine learning, the initiative aims to
transform fields such as new materials discovery and green energy
solutions while improving our ability to model and predict natural
phenomena across varying scales of space and time. For example,
the AI for Science team developed MatterGen3 and MatterSim4
generative models which enable predicting ground-state material
structures and energetics and simulating their behavior under
realistic temperatures and pressures, which can lead to up to
tenfold enhancement in accuracy compared to the prior best-in-
class approaches and orders of magnitude increase in speed.


### INNOVATION SPOTLIGHT

Accelerating the
discovery of new
materials

Researchers are using AI to predict the properties of materials, dramatically
reducing the time and cost associated with traditional, experimental materials
design and leading to the discovery of entirely new materials. Microsoft and
the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) used AI to discover a new
battery material requiring less lithium-a breakthrough achieved in weeks
rather than the years that traditional research and development would have
required.37 Reducing lithium dependence is crucial to decarbonization as
global demand for lithium is projected to outpace supply.1

<!-- PageHeader="Looking ahead" -->

In another project, Microsoft Research and Microsoft's Cloud
Operation and Innovation team have partnered with the
University of Michigan to advance long-duration energy storage
(LDES) technologies, a fundamental need for grid reliability as
more intermittent renewable energy, such as wind and solar, are
integrated into the electricity mix. Traditional flow batteries often
rely on vanadium, an element that is costly and impractical for
large-scale deployment.40 To overcome this limitation, Microsoft
researchers are using computational tools and generative
machine learning models to design organic redox-active
molecules as alternatives to high-cost vanadium.41 These organic
molecules offer lower costs, avoid reliance on critical high-cost
minerals, reduce corrosion hazards, and are non-toxic.41 This
innovative energy storage solution is expected to enable greater
grid integration of renewable energy sources like wind and solar.41


#### Climate risk management

Plants selected and cultivated as food crops by human
communities over the last 10,000 years42 are increasingly
vulnerable to extreme weather and climate change.43,44 Climate
risk in agriculture is exacerbated by current modes of cultivation.
For example, many staple crops, like maize, are cultivated
in genetically-simplified monocultures with low resilience
to climate variability.45

However, research institutions like the Consultative Group for
International Agricultural Research have begun applying Al's
second game-changing capability: it is using AI to scan the
genomes of crops for resilient traits and selectively breed varieties
that can tolerate a wider range of climate variability.35 This is just
one example of how AI is facilitating the creation of resilient,
productive, and profitable crop varieties at unprecedented
speed and scale.

Microsoft is investing broadly in AI to accelerate climate risk
solutions for agriculture. We are collaborating with Bayer to
develop Microsoft Azure Data Manager for Agriculture, which
allows organizations to anticipate business challenges and
manage operational risks like climate change by integrating
diverse datasets-such as weather patterns, soil conditions,
and crop health-into a unified Al-powered platform.46 Bayer's
AgPowered Services such as Historical Weather, Imagery Insights
for scouting, and data connectors for Smart Irrigation are
allowing organizations to increase the speed of predictive models,
optimize farming practices, and simplify the development of
digital solutions.47 Generative AI tools from Bayer will also help
to support regulatory and sustainability practices.48


### INNOVATION SPOTLIGHT


#### Generative Chemistry

Unleashing a new wave
of creativity for scientists

Generative Chemistry will unleash a new wave of creativity for scientists tasked with discovering
and designing new molecules with wide-reaching sustainability applications.38 Researchers
can ask Generative Chemistry for molecules with desired characteristics, such as the ability to
degrade rapidly or be recycled more easily.39 They can also provide information about their
targeted application and let the system help determine relevant molecular properties.39 After a
few more steps, they receive a set of candidates matching those parameters for further study.

However, simply generating candidates is not sufficient for transforming the discovery
process with AI. The essential criteria for computational tools in chemistry are that they
help scientists discover molecules that are novel, synthesizable, and useful in the real world.
Generative Chemistry can suggest molecules that have not been seen before, with useful
properties tuned for a specific application, and whose synthesis is feasible in a reasonable
number of steps.

Generative Chemistry will offer researchers potential steps to consider as they develop
their recipe for synthesizing these molecular candidates in a laboratory-further helping
to accelerate the development and deployment of sustainability solutions.

### 3 Investing in AI to empower the sustainability workforce

Addressing sustainability challenges requires a workforce that is
knowledgeable about a range of rapidly evolving environmental
science, technologies, regulations, and more. But wide gaps
in expertise, capacity, and resources exist, which can hinder
progress.49 AI is helping to close these gaps by providing
access to knowledge, personalized training, and personalized
assistants-such as Microsoft Copilot-that make the rapidly
expanding sustainability data and information more broadly
accessible. At the same time, AI is scaling the impact of people
and organizations by enhancing decision-making, automating
tasks, and delivering advanced insights. From streamlining
sustainability reporting and supporting farmers with tailored
guidance to helping stakeholders navigate vast and evolving
sustainability information, the following examples highlight how
Microsoft is investing in this third game-changing capability of
Al to close gaps and amplify the workforce's impact in the
energy and climate risk management sectors.


#### Net-zero energy transition

By integrating AI into daily operations, companies are enhancing
productivity, streamlining processes, and enabling employees to
focus on high-value tasks that contribute to sustainability goals.

Currently, the licensing and permitting process for carbon-
free energy projects in the United States is costly. For instance,
the permit approval and licensing processes alone for the
average nuclear power plant can extend up to 12 years and
cost $50-100 million.50 Microsoft is working to help to expedite
these processes. For example, Microsoft is developing an
advanced generative AI-based solution aimed at enhancing the
productivity of companies and licensing experts navigating the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensing process and
other nuclear licensing processes globally.51

Microsoft is developing a generative
AI -based solution to enhance the
productivity of companies and licensing
experts undergoing Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) licensing and other
nuclear licensing processes, globally.
This solution trains on historic licensing
data to streamline the licensing process for
small modular reactors and utility partners.
It automatically retrieves real-time or site-
specific information, such as flood and
earthquake history data for a particular
area, and converts this information into
documentation that can be used in
licensing applications. This solution uses
generative AI to apply multiple large
language models designed for specific
permitting or licensing tasks. Generative AI
can assist with drafting documents using
existing datasets, which are then plugged
into a licensing workflow for human review
and improvement, significantly enhancing
the productivity of permitting engineers.

Keeping up with the latest energy data presents another
challenge for those working on energy issues. To help address
this, the International Energy Agency (IEA) in cooperation with
Microsoft developed the WEO-GPT tool hosted on IEA's website.
Built on Microsoft Azure using Copilot Studio, the WEO-GPT tool
has been trained on the full World Energy Outlook 2024 report
and provides answers based on World Energy Outlook (WEO)
content2,52. It allows users to ask questions about the report
using natural, conversational language.52 The tool is designed
for anyone curious about the report's findings to more easily
dig into its data, analysis, and projections.


#### Climate risk management

AI is being used to empower the workforce engaged in climate
risk management. Microsoft has partnered with organizations
around the world to develop AI-powered Copilot assistants that
are helping people rapidly upskill and more effectively manage
climate risks.

For example, Microsoft and the International Water Management
Institute (IWMI) have partnered to develop a Water Copilot for
the Limpopo River Basin, which includes parts of Botswana,
Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Mozambique.53 The copilot is
based on a comprehensive knowledge base that integrates
multilingual regulatory documents, scientific reports, remote-
sensing workflows, and near real-time sensor data from across the
watershed.54 Users can interact with the copilot and retrieve data
from these widespread sources through a chat interface powered
by GPT-4, empowering decision-makers with critical insights on
flows and water availability related to drought and other climate
risks.54 Microsoft's partnership with IWMI is facilitating informed,
collaborative, and sustainable management of an important
African river basin.

Climate change has also led to an estimated 21% decline in
global agricultural productivity since 196155 and as temperatures
increase so do the risks to food security around the world.56
There is a widespread movement to improve management
practices for both optimizing current yields and ensuring the
future productivity of agroecosystems.57 Microsoft uses AI to
advance that research and bring it to farmers in the field.

### AI for Good Lab

Empowering communities to
respond to extreme weather

Microsoft's Al for Good Lab has collaborated with Planet
Labs PBC to deploy AI models that improve the accuracy
and speed of assessing vulnerabilities to and damage from
natural disasters, including wildfires, floods, and hurricanes.
These tools provide detailed insights-not just the number
of buildings damaged, but also the extent of damage to
each structure. This information has helped humanitarian
organizations prioritize aid, guide recovery efforts, and
accelerate the restoration of affected communities.
Having already used these models to inform disaster
response from Libya to Spain and Turkey to Granada, we are
continually improving them and making them accessible to
humanitarian and emergency response teams worldwide.

### Biodiversity protection

The UN estimates that over half of the global economy is
dependent on biodiversity and ecosystem services.59 The
Global Framework on Biodiversity explicitly names companies
as important partners in halting and reversing declines in
nature.60 Several emerging environmental-social-governance
(ESG) frameworks, such as the European Union's Corporate
Sustainability Reporting Directive,61 are beginning to require
companies to measure and report how they affect and depend
on critical aspects of nature like biodiversity. Microsoft partnered
with Planet Labs PBC, the University of Vermont's Gund Institute
for the Environment, and the Natural Capital Project to highlight
how recent advancements in AI-enabled Earth observation
technologies can be used to facilitate the measurement,
reporting, and ultimately protection of biodiversity at scale.62

These technologies include AI-enabled camera traps,
bioacoustics, and high-resolution satellite imagery, and
potentially other tools like Microsoft Premonition, an automated
environmental DNA measurement platform also enabled by
cloud computing and AI.63 Effective monitoring and reporting
biodiversity and complex ecosystems, globally, will arguably
be impossible without such AI-enabled tools.


### INNOVATION SPOTLIGHT

AgPilot

Empowering farmers to create
more resilient food systems

Microsoft's partner Headstorm developed a copilot, AgPilot, which provides
farmers with actionable insights that facilitate more sustainable practices.
AgPilot uses generative AI along with data from Microsoft Azure Data
Manager for Agriculture to provide real-time access to critical agricultural
data like soil health, crop conditions, weather forecasts, and pest and disease
information.58 Farmers can use AgPilot to identify potential pest and disease
threats before they become widespread. This proactive approach allows for
more effective and minimal use of chemicals, supporting eco-friendly pest
control methods.

### Accelerating Sustainability with AI


### Play 2: Develop digital and data infrastructure for the inclusive use of AI for sustainability

Without access to sufficient, high-
quality data and robust digital
infrastructure, the full potential of Al's
game-changing capabilities cannot
be realized.

Play Two focuses on developing the
digital and data infrastructure needed
to ensure AI can be applied inclusively
and effectively for sustainability.
Microsoft is helping to address critical
gaps in data and accessibility and
expand access to the infrastructure
required to unlock Al's transformative
power on a global scale.


#### Filling gaps and making data more accessible

The effectiveness of AI tools to help manage and predict complex
systems, accelerate development of solutions, and empower
the workforce depends on the quality of data used to build AI
models.64,65 Insufficient or low-quality data can lead to inaccurate
or biased model insights,66 spurious predictions,67 and unreliable
recommendations.68 Additionally, data must be available in
formats that AI models can process effectively. Following, we
highlight examples of how Microsoft is helping to fill gaps and
increase accessibility of data that can help strengthen AI models
to support three sectors: climate risk management, biodiversity,
and carbon removal.


#### Climate risk management

Between 2010 and 2020, almost 18 million people in Asia were
displaced by natural hazards, compared with around 1 million
people in North America.69 As the world experiences increasingly
severe impacts of climate change, we need better tools to support
communities before, during, and after extreme weather events.
AI-enabled models can help people better understand and
predict complex climate risks (Al's first game-changing capability)
and inform risk prevention,70 empowering disaster response
teams71 and resource mobilization72 (Al's third game-changing
capability). But poor data in many regions limit the effectiveness
of these models to provide robust insights and predictions to
support decision making.

<!-- PageFooter="Accelerating Sustainability with AI: Innovations for a Better Future" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Data & Infrastructure" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Energy & Resources Policy & Governance" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Workforce capacity" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Looking ahead" -->

For example, household census data and associated demographic
metadata are often outdated and incomplete, failing to capture
high-density clustering of populations in temporary and
dynamic housing, particularly in the developing world.73 To help
fill these data gaps, Microsoft is working with the University of
Washington's Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) to
use high-resolution satellite imagery from Planet Labs PBC, spatial
demographic analysis, and AI to estimate the extent of the built
environment and how population is changing over time.74

Data access can also constrain the full potential of Al's game-
changing capabilities. For example, satellites collect increasing
amounts of data each year, creating a growing data repository
of tremendous value for managing climate risks, accelerating the
discovery of new insights to help address a range of sustainability
challenges. But these data can be difficult to access, and if they
cannot be easily accessed, then they cannot be widely used for
sustainability solutions. To tackle these challenges, NASA IMPACT
collaborated with Microsoft to develop Earth Copilot, which
allows users to interact with NASA's data repository through
plain language queries, facilitating a broader range of users in
interacting with its Earth science data.75


#### Biodiversity protection

Data limitations constrain the ability to use Al's full potential
to measure, protect, and report on biodiversity. It is estimated
that less than 7% of the world's ecosystems have been surveyed
for biodiversity at a spatial resolution of 5 square kilometers or
less,76 with nearly 80% of the available data coming from just 10
countries in the Northern Hemisphere (Figure 1).77

These large data gaps persist in large part because traditional
field-based biodiversity observations are expensive and
time-consuming and are thus difficult to scale. However, new
Al-enabled technologies like Microsoft's SPARROW can help
overcome this challenge.6,79 SPARROW-an autonomous
Solar-Powered Acoustic and Remote Recording Observation
Watch-integrates Al-enabled camera, bioacoustics, and other
environmental sensors on a single platform that can be deployed
to the remotest reaches of the planet and transmit resulting
data directly to satellites overhead.6 Thus, AI-enabled sensors
used by Project Guacamaya32 and SPARROW6 not only fill gaps
in observational biodiversity data but also incorporate new
types of data from bioacoustics and satellites into biodiversity
observation networks.30,62,79

Today, 18,000
researchers and
organizations currently
rely on biodiversity
and ecosystem
monitoring data.

SPARROW

Solar-Powered Acoustic and Remote Recording Observation Watch
(SPARROW) is an innovative new AI-powered biodiversity monitoring tool
developed by Microsoft's Al for Good lab. Its advanced solar-powered
sensors record camera footage, bioacoustics, and other environmental data.
SPARROW is enabled by species identification algorithms that run on low-
energy graphical processing units, with data transmitted to satellites in orbit
for use anywhere in the world. Every aspect of SPARROW, from its hardware
that is designed to be 3D printed to its open-source algorithms, is designed to
facilitate its large-scale deployment. Today, 18,000 researchers and organizations
currently rely on biodiversity and ecosystem monitoring data, and this number
is growing under new ESG reporting frameworks.6 This tool offers to scale
measurements and fill gaps in biodiversity data around the world.

The data collected by these innovative new sensors can serve
as key inputs in emerging AI-enabled biodiversity observation
networks.76 Microsoft has also collaborated with an international
team, led by GEO BON, to develop a framework for a Global
Biodiversity Observation System (GBiOS).76 GBiOS will use AI to
integrate data collected around the world, monitor change, and
help scientists and policy-makers halt and reverse declines in
biodiversity.76


##### Carbon dioxide removal

Carbon dioxide removal technologies that depend on natural
processes such as forest sequestration, soil sequestration, or
enhanced-rock weathering (ERW) can vary in effectiveness
over space and time. This is an example where Al's first game-
changing capability is starting to be applied to optimize the
deployment of carbon dioxide removal strategies by analyzing
complex environmental datasets.80 However, data gaps limit the
effectiveness of many models.

Microsoft is investing in companies like Terradot, which is
helping to fill data gaps to improve deployment of ERW.

<!-- PageFooter="Accelerating Sustainability with AI: Innovations for a Better Future" -->

ERW involves a complex series of reactions between crushed
rock, land, and water, which naturally absorb carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere. But, these reactions vary across different
environments. Terradot aims to remove gigatons of carbon
dioxide from the atmosphere by using AI to optimize the
deployment of ERW at scale.81 By performing thousands of
measurements in the field and laboratory on variables such
groundwater pH, soil type, and organic carbon content, to
name just a few,81 Terradot is building the datasets needed to
determine the locations where ERW will be most effective.81
Such optimization will maximize carbon dioxide removal by
this promising nature-based solution.

As multiple initiatives around the world work to fill gaps in
data for sustainability solutions, these new data will need to
meet standards of quality, formatting, and documentation to
be accessible and interoperable by AI models.82 Formatting
guidelines are being developed for specific domains,82 but will
need to be expanded across domains, particularly for general-
purpose foundation models.

##### Expanding access to digital infrastructure

The application of AI globally to accelerate sustainability is also
hindered by limited access to digital infrastructure. As of 2023, one
third of the world still lacked internet access.83 While connectivity
trends are improving, progress remains uneven.84 More than half
of the globe lacks internet connectivity at the broadband speeds
that enable productive use of cloud services and AI.83

Globally, 2.7 billion people remain disconnected from the internet
and therefore cannot use AI to accelerate sustainability or develop
solutions to other challenges facing society.83 At Microsoft, we
believe that internet access and meaningful connectivity are
fundamental rights that allow people to "work, learn, and interact
with the world."85 We are helping to expand access to internet and
broadband, cloud services and AI, and even cellular networks.

Across Latin America and Africa, only 37% and 40% of the
population, respectively, have internet access.85 Microsoft's
Airband Initiative is dedicated to helping to close this global
digital divide. Airband fosters private sector investment and
leverages innovative technologies while advocating for regulatory
support and financial frameworks to expand connectivity access.10,85
Airband is working to help extend internet coverage to 250 million
people worldwide by the end of 2025.85 Since 2017, Airband
has helped bring high-speed internet access to over 100 million
people around the world, including nearly 40 million in Africa.

These partnerships have also enabled the development
of digital infrastructure and off-grid energy solutions in
underserved communities, utilizing fiber, fixed wireless, solar
energy, satellite, and other technologies to deepen digital
access in these regions.10,85

Expanded access to the power of AI also requires access to
both internet connectivity and significant computing power.
Microsoft is helping to address this need in East Africa by
partnering with G42 to build a new datacenter in Kenya powered
entirely by geothermal energy.7 This facility will provide access
to scalable, secure, high-speed cloud and AI services, supporting
the digital transformation of businesses, customers, and partners
across Kenya and East Africa.

Lack of access to cell phone networks also prevents many
communities around the world from benefiting from AI-enabled
services. Microsoft, the IHME, Planet Labs PBC, and the University
of Washington are helping the United Nations to create a "Global
Map of the Unconnected" who remain outside of cell phone
network coverage.87 This data can help improve the development
of AI-based models for climate vulnerability assessments and
disaster response. For example, Microsoft is working with UN in
its Early Warnings for All initiative, which will use AI to predict the
likelihood of natural hazards like heat waves and tsunamis and
alert people to seek cover with push notifications sent directly to
individual cell phones.88 Knowing where people lack connectivity
could be used in these systems to improve the models to identify
vulnerable regions and help target lifesaving response.

#### Accelerating Sustainability with AI


#### Play 3: Minimize resource use, expand access to carbon-free electricity, and support local communities

AI operations require resources, such as energy and water.
To expand the power and applications of Al's three game-
changing capabilities for sustainability, AI operations must align
with global sustainability goals to achieve a net zero and nature
positive future. To this end, in our playbook released in 2023, we
developed Play Three to focus on minimizing resource use in the
development and operations of AI infrastructure. However, over
the last year, it has become clear that minimizing the sustainability
impact of AI operations requires more than minimizing resource
use in datacenter operations; it also requires supporting the
decarbonization of the local energy grids that datacenters and
the rest of society's vital infrastructure rely upon.


##### Expanding Play 3

The continued development of AI will increase the demand for
resources, but how much more electric power capacity is needed
will depend on how AI models are designed and operated, how
technologies advance, and the pace of AI adoption.

Currently, datacenters account for approximately 1.0-1.5%
of global electricity demand, with the majority of datacenters
being used for non-AI applications.89 Even with current growth
rates, the IEA projects that datacenters and AI will account for a
relatively small share of global growth in electricity demand out
to 2030 (see Figure 2).2 Although AI and datacenters represent a
small percentage of global electricity consumption, the projected
growth is concentrated in a few regions.

For example, the IEA projects that in the next couple of years
20% of the expected increase in global datacenter electricity
demand will come from Ireland and Denmark.90 In the United
States, the country with the most datacenters, the IEA projects
electricity consumption to grow at a rapid pace, increasing from
approximately 4% of US electricity demand to almost 6% by
2026.90 This demand growth can be challenging in locations with
aging transmission infrastructure and competing demand due
in part to increased electrification in transportation, buildings,
and other sectors.

The climate implications of increased electricity demand
depend on the energy source. If demand is met by carbon-free
energy, such as solar or wind, greenhouse gas emissions will not
increase. However, in many regions, datacenters have limited
access to highly consistent carbon-free power, which they require.
To address the challenges of intermittency of renewable energy,
energy storage solutions or non-variable energy sources-
such as hydro, geothermal, nuclear, or gas with carbon capture
and storage-are needed to ensure a continuous reliable
electricity supply.2

In response to these challenges, we are focused on three areas
for enhancing the sustainability of AI infrastructure: minimizing
resource use, expanding access to carbon-free electricity, and
supporting local communities in achieving their social, economic,
and sustainability goals.

<!-- PageHeader="Looking ahead" -->


##### Minimizing resource use

Microsoft and the technology industry more broadly must
minimize resource use across the whole tech stack by making
AI compute more resource-efficient, redesigning AI operations
for efficiency, and bringing to market new solutions for low
carbon materials that minimize embodied carbon associated
with AI hardware.


##### Efficiency in AI compute

Over the last year, large language models, such as the models
that power tools like Copilot and ChatGPT, have become more
powerful in helping people and organizations achieve more,
faster, cheaper, and better. At the same time, we have been
innovating to reduce the energy needed to run our models.
For example, we have released a suite of small language models
(SLMs) called "Phi" that reduce computational demands while
matching and even outperforming for certain tasks models up to
25 times larger.91 Microsoft Phi-3 models are the most proficient
and economical SLMs available, consistently surpassing models of
comparable and larger sizes across various language, reasoning,
coding, and mathematical benchmarks.91

Another way we improve power efficiency involves distributing
workloads intelligently across datacenters to safely harvest any
unused power and maximize the use of our available power.
Since 2019, this work has recovered about 800 MWh of electric
energy from datacenters, enough to power an electric car for
2.8 million miles.92 Also, we are working on multiple fronts
to reduce the power and carbon footprint of AI datacenters,
including active load management and time and spatial
load shifting.93

##### Hardware circularity and efficiency

To reduce the resource footprint of AI computing, the industry
must increase the efficiency of hardware energy consumption and
reduce the lifecycle impact of materials used in storage devices,
processors, and related electronic components.

As AI chips are designed for higher performance capabilities,
they can consume more total energy consumption per chip.
For example, NVIDIA's H100 GPU has a power consumption of
approximately 10 kW,94 nearly 1.5 times that of its predecessor,
the A100.95 Innovation is driving down the energy intensity
of compute, even as energy consumption per chip increases.
This trend is expected to continue (see Figure 3).96

Microsoft is working to build circularity into hardware design.
Microsoft Research has collaborated with the University of
Washington to develop more sustainable and recyclable
materials for electronic devices, utilizing AI in this endeavor.97
To facilitate easier recycling, the team fabricated a prototype
circuit board from a class of plastics called vitrimers that can
be disassembled into its individual components.97 They are also
employing AI to design new vitrimers with specific properties
for advanced materials.97

In addition, the Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund has invested
in Cyclic Materials to scale recycling of magnets from hard disk
drives. Currently, only 1% of rare earth elements are recovered
globally.98 Cyclic Materials helps reduce the need for mining and
processing new materials. This circular solution also uses far less
water and energy than extracting virgin materials.


###### Datacenter design and operations

Microsoft is redesigning construction and management of
datacenters for greater resource use efficiency and circularity.
For example, we have just completed construction of a datacenter
with cross-laminated timber, reducing the carbon footprint of
its construction materials.8 In addition, the Microsoft Climate
Innovation Fund is supporting development of low-carbon
construction materials, such as low-emissions steel, by investing
in companies like Stegra (formerly known as H2 Green Steel),
which produces steel with a reduction of up to 95% of the
emissions of conventional steel production.99 Microsoft Research
is working with the datacenter team to harness the power of
reinforcement learning to add intelligence to traditional HVAC
controls, creating systems that enable real-time adjustments
which can reduce energy and water use.100


##### INNOVATION SPOTLIGHT


###### Low-carbon materials Decarbonizing the built environment

At Microsoft, we are innovating the materials used for
datacenter exteriors by constructing our first datacenters
with lightweight wood to reduce reliance on steel and
concrete. Microsoft engineers have developed a hybrid
datacenter design that incorporates cross-laminated timber,
a fire-resistant prefabricated wood material. This hybrid
construction model, combining mass timber, steel, and
concrete, is projected to lower the carbon footprint of
two new datacenters by 35% compared to conventional
steel construction, and by 65% compared to typical
precast concrete.8

Microsoft has also reduced water consumption with
innovative cooling technologies in new datacenter designs.
Through advancements in datacenter operations and chip design,
we have cut water intensity (water consumed per kilowatt-hour)
by over 80% since the early 2000s.101 Direct-to-chip cooling, such
as cold plates, dissipates heat more efficiently than traditional
air cooling by directly chilling the silicon and recirculating the
cooling fluid in a closed-loop system. This method enhances
cooling efficiency and allows for precise temperature control.
To take advantage of these benefits, Microsoft is developing new
datacenter designs optimized for direct-to-chip cooling, which
involves reconfiguring server and rack layouts to accommodate
advanced thermal and power management techniques.

In existing facilities, innovations like the "sidekick" liquid cooling
system are employed alongside racks of Microsoft Azure Maia
AI Accelerator chips, circulating fluid to draw heat away from the
cold plates attached to the chips' surfaces. Additionally, Microsoft
is exploring microfluidics, a technology that integrates tiny fluid
channels into chip designs, bringing coolant directly next to
processors for increased efficiency and precision.

Our newest datacenter designs are optimized to support AI
workloads and consume zero water for cooling. To achieve this,
we're transitioning to chip-level cooling solutions, providing
precise temperature cooling only where it's needed and without
requiring evaporation. With these innovations, we can significantly
reduce water consumption while supporting higher rack
capacity, enabling more compute power per square foot within
our datacenters.


###### Expanding access to carbon-free electricity

We are working to accelerate the decarbonization of electricity
for our company, our customers, and the global community.
Microsoft is one of the largest corporate purchasers of renewable
energy and has contracted over 34 GW of renewable energy
across 24 countries.9 We are supporting the addition of carbon-
free electricity generation and transmission capacity to the grids.
For example, in Ireland, Microsoft has signed power purchase
agreements (PPAs) with FuturEnergy Ireland, SSE Renewables,
Statkraft, Energia Group, and Power Capital Renewable Energy
to add 900 megawatts (MW) of new wind and solar capacity.103

<!-- PageFooter="Accelerating Sustainability with AI: Innovations for a Better Future" -->
<!-- PageNumber="24" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="Foreword" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Actions & Innovations" -->
<!-- PageHeader="AI Investments Data & Infrastructure" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Energy & Resources" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Policy & Governance" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Workforce capacity" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Looking ahead" -->

We signed a five-year agreement with Brookfield Renewable
Partners that sets out a pathway to develop more than 10.5
GW of new renewable energy capacity in the United States
and Europe. 104 This is nearly eight times larger than the largest
previous corporate PPA, contributing to grid decarbonization
in locations where Microsoft uses electricity.104

Electricity grids powered by intermittent renewable energy
sources, like wind and solar, cannot fully meet datacenter
electricity demands unless they are complemented with long-
term energy storage or non-intermittent ("firm") energy sources.
For this reason, Microsoft is expanding investments in lowering
the cost of energy storage and also developing PPAs with
providers of firm carbon-free energy. We recently signed a PPA
with Constellation, which will enable the restart of an 835-MW
nuclear facility in Pennsylvania that was retired in 2019.105

We are also investing in advancing geothermal as an
increasingly scalable firm renewable option.106 For example,
Microsoft's new datacenter in New Zealand will be supported by
100% carbon-free electricity as a result of the 10-year agreement
that Microsoft signed with Contact Energy for the renewable
attributes produced by Te Huka 3 geothermal power station.107

The long-term contract with Microsoft supported Contact's
investment decision to construct the Te Huka 3 power station
and can generate 51.4 MW of reliable and renewable generation
throughout the year.107 Earlier in 2024, we signed an agreement
with G42, in collaboration with local partners, to design and
build a state-of-the-art datacenter campus in Olkaria, Kenya,
run entirely on renewable geothermal energy and designed with
state-of-the-art water conservation technology .? Our Climate
Innovation Fund is also investing in companies like Eavor, which
is developing next-generation geothermal energy technology
that can be deployed in a much wider variety of settings
compared to traditional geothermal approaches.108

$2.5M

Microsoft has invested over $2.5 million in community
programs across more than 70 partners in Iowa.
The funding has supported financial and computer
classes for immigrants and refugees, skilling and
career development for underserved populations,
and the Microsoft Datacenter Academy, a workforce
development program for IT sector employment.


###### Supporting local communities

Microsoft's global network of advanced datacenters relies
on the support of local suppliers, officials, stakeholders,
and residents to plan, build, and run these facilities. We are
committed to being responsible neighbors, contributing to local
economies and ecosystems, and ensuring that our datacenters
address community needs and priorities.109 For example, in West
Des Moines, Iowa, where Microsoft operates datacenters, we
have invested directly in supporting the community through
partnerships with educational institutions and support for
infrastructure projects like the construction of a water tower,
new schools, and new bridges.110

We collaborate to identify opportunities to create efficiency
and bring value to local communities. For example, in Finland,
we joined forces with the public utility Fortum to build a
datacenter area that produces emission-free heat for Fortum's
customers in the Helsinki metropolitan area.111 Additionally, in
Quincy, Washington, we partnered with the city to open the
state's first industrial water reuse center. In Ireland, we integrated
batteries into wind turbines for a wind energy project, allowing
us to capture excess energy when the turbines over-perform
and deliver it to the local grid. Similarly, in Denmark, excess heat
generated from a Microsoft datacenter will be used to heat the
local community, providing enough warmth for around 6,000
homes.112 These are examples of how we are using our datacenters
as a source of energy to relieve pressure on local electric grids.

<!-- PageHeader="AI Investments Data & Infrastructure" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Energy & Resources" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Policy & Governance" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Workforce capacity" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Looking ahead" -->

We also partner with local stakeholders to provide educational
programs, grants, and initiatives aligned with community needs,
including digital skills training and STEM education. For example,
Microsoft has invested over $2.5 million in community programs
across more than 70 partners in Iowa.113 The funding has
supported financial and computer classes for immigrants and
refugees, skilling and career development for underserved
populations, and the Microsoft Datacenter Academy, a workforce
development program for IT sector employment. In Singapore,
Microsoft opened Asia's first Datacenter Academy in collaboration
with the Institute of Technical Education, offering students
hands-on experience and training for careers in the datacenter
industry.114 In Taiwan, as part of the "Reimagine Taiwan" initiative,
Microsoft is establishing its first datacenter region, aiming
to upskill over 200,000 workers through a variety of digital
training programs.115 Through these efforts, we aim to empower
community members with future-ready skills necessary for
the digital age.

Microsoft also contributes to the restoration of local ecosystems
adjacent to its datacenter sites. For example, we have partnered
with the Society for Ecological Restoration to implement science-
based, community-driven ecological restoration projects at
18 datacenter sites worldwide.116 We have also partnered with
One Tree Planted,117 American Forests,118 and Forestami119 on
urban forestry projects in datacenter communities to plant over
100,000 trees. Similarly, we have restored degraded stream
ecosystems near our datacenters from Racine, Wisconsin120
to Jakarta, Indonesia.117

###### Investing in Innovation & Scaling Markets


###### The Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund

For Microsoft and the world to sustainably realize the promise
of Al, a greater market supply of climate solutions like carbon-
free electricity, materials, fuels, and carbon removal is needed.
To deliver on this future, we are creating and scaling the
markets from which we purchase our goods and services.

The Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund (CIF) offers a case
study in building new markets to deliver the solutions we need.
Through the CIF's $1 billion investment mandate,142 Microsoft
has so far invested over $760 million to bring new supply to
market and to accelerate adoption and cost reduction in key
target technologies.

By serving as both an early buyer and an investor in the
technologies to provide carbon-free energy, advanced
materials, circularity, and more, Microsoft acts to kickstart
a market process that drives down cost and drives up supply.
Our capital and purchase commitments attract additional
partners in a multiplier effect to grow these markets.

Through the CIF, Microsoft is providing the demand signal
and capital, along with engagement and technical solutions
needed to proactively scale markets for a sustainable Al
industrial revolution.

##### Accelerating Sustainability with AI


#### Play 4: Advance Al policy principles and governance for sustainability

Without effective policies and
governance structures, the full
potential of Al's three gaming-
changing capabilities for accelerating
sustainability progress cannot be
realized. Play Four focuses on
advancing AI policy principles
and governance to help accelerate
decarbonization of the energy
system, as well as incentivizing
and guiding the proper use of
AI for sustainability solutions.

Policies and governance play a critical role in enabling AI to
accelerate sustainability progress. Government policies are
essential for facilitating the decarbonization of electricity grids
and incentivizing the responsible use of AI in sustainability
solutions. At the same time, ensuring that AI models are safe,
secure, and trustworthy is vital for their deployment in managing
the essential systems that underpin sustainability progress.

The following examples highlight how Microsoft is helping to
advance the development of policies and governance frameworks
that facilitate the development and widespread deployment of
Al's three game-changing capabilities.


##### Advocating for policies that accelerate decarbonization of electricity grids

At Microsoft, we are working to accelerate carbon-free electricity,
expand grid infrastructure, and scale markets through policy
advocacy in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Over the past
year, in the United States, we supported new Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) transmission rules to improve and
expedite regional grid planning, as well as proposals to streamline
permitting for energy and grid projects, and federal and state
legislation advancing fusion energy and small modular reactors.
Additionally, we advocated for policies that support clean energy,
carbon removal, sustainable aviation fuel, and manufacturing
initiatives, which formalized community benefits plan requirements
to support historically disadvantaged communities.

<!-- PageFooter="Accelerating Sustainability with AI: Innovations for a Better Future" -->
<!-- PageNumber="28" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="Foreword" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Actions & Innovations" -->
<!-- PageHeader="AI Investments" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Data & Infrastructure" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Energy & Resources" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Policy & Governance" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Workforce capacity" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Looking ahead" -->

Alongside our longstanding advocacy on renewable energy
issues, we expanded our policy engagement on nuclear, fusion,
and other advanced carbon-free solutions by joining the US
Nuclear Industry Council, EU SMR Alliance, and Fusion Industry
Association. As outlined in our policy brief Accelerating A Carbon-
Free Future, we advocate for a diversity of technologies including
advanced nuclear energy as critical to achieving net-zero energy
systems, including resilient, decarbonized energy grids.122

Globally, we have collaborated with organizations to use AI
to accelerate policy implementation. For example, Microsoft
has partnered with the United Nations Framework Convention
on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to develop an AI-enabled
platform and global data hub to simplify the validation and
analysis of climate data submitted by the 195 parties to the
Paris Agreement, supporting transparency and reporting of
greenhouse gas emissions.


##### Aligning policies to incentivize and guide the use of AI for sustainability

AI is proving to provide tremendous value in a wide range of
sustainability-related areas, such as the management of energy
systems,123 water resources,124 and supply chains,125 as well as in
ESG reporting.62 But many organizations do not yet have the
capacity to use these tools effectively. As discussed in Play Four,
capacity building is critical, but policies and governance will also
be important as these systems rapidly evolve and are deployed.

At Microsoft, we are engaging broadly to help shape the
best practices for using AI for sustainability, including through
engagements with the UNFCCC on climate, the IEA on energy,
and the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (UN
CBD) on biodiversity. For example, at COP16, Microsoft met with
government and science leaders to demonstrate Al's potential in
biodiversity monitoring and share best practices for its effective
use. During these discussions, we highlighted initiatives like
Project Guacamaya-developed in collaboration with PlanetLabs
PBC and Colombian research institutions-which developed
AI enabled solutions to monitor biodiversity.

Sustainability policies need to be aligned to incentivize and
guide the use of AI for sustainability progress, including potential
applications for AI to support energy efficiency and carbon-
free energy deployment. With effective policies in place, AI can
maximize its sustainability impacts across industries, optimizing
systems, enhancing efficiencies, and improving systems from
manufacturing to electric grid management. Enabling AI through
supporting policies is critical to addressing complex sustainability
challenges from climate and energy to biodiversity and water.

Microsoft is working with governments and policy stakeholders
to responsibly use AI for sustainability outcomes. This past year,
Microsoft provided input and comments to the US Department
of Energy's request for information on the energy portions
of the Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy
Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence. Through our
engagement, we outlined ways that AI can advance clean,
reliable, and resilient electric power.


##### Governing AI to help ensure that it is safe, secure, and trusted

We are also committed to governance that ensures AI is safe,
secure, and trustworthy. Transparency and accountability
are crucial for building trust in AI systems, which is essential
for their adoption in sustainability efforts. For example, in
managing electricity grids, AI systems must provide reliable
insights to optimize load generation and transmission resources
(including variable renewable resources and new loads) without
compromising grid stability. Transparency in AI operations
ensures that grid operators can understand and validate the
recommendations made by these systems, reducing the risk
of system failures or inefficiencies.

To address these needs, Microsoft's internal Responsible Al
standard aligns with the core functions of frameworks such as
the US National Institute of Standards and Technology's Al Risk
Management Framework, which provides guidance on identifying
and mitigating potential risks in Al deployment.126 Microsoft's 2024
Responsible AI Transparency Report details our commitment to
safety and accountability in AI development and deployment.127
We also collaborate with external stakeholders to advance AI
governance and promote safety, security, and trust more broadly.
For example, our Chief Responsible AI Officer was a member
of the United Nations High-level Advisory Body on AI that
produced the report Governing AI for Humanity.128 The author
panel brought together experts from diverse sectors to provide
strategic guidance on developing and implementing global AI
governance frameworks. The panel's work focused on providing
guidance to help ensure that AI technologies are designed
and deployed in ways that prioritize equity, accountability,
and alignment with sustainable development goals.

Accelerating Sustainability with AI


##### Play 5: Build capacity for the workforce to use AI for sustainability

For Al's three game-changing
capabilities to be put to work at
scale, people across all sectors must
have skills to use AI effectively and
understanding of its capabilities
and limitations. For this reason,
the final play, Play Five, is to build
capacity for the workforce to use
AI for sustainability.

At Microsoft, we believe that building this workforce capacity
requires action on two fronts. First, there is a need to build
both AI fluency and sustainability fluency broadly across
society. AI fluency refers to a broad understanding of what
AI can do, what it cannot do, and how to use AI responsibly.
Sustainability fluency refers to understanding Earth's life-
supporting systems, as well as how humanity is changing them
and what can be done to protect them. Second, there is a need
to empower people with more specialized skills and support
them in applying AI to specific sustainability challenges, such as
advancing carbon-free energy systems, monitoring ecosystems,
or accelerating circular economy solutions.


###### Building AI fluency

In the era of generative AI, building AI capacity is less about
programming and more about building broader AI fluency where
individuals learn to work with AI-enabled tools, such as Copilot,
to enhance innovation, help build sustainability solutions, and
scale impacts.

Microsoft has launched training programs focused on building
AI fluency, supporting nonprofits, businesses, and governments
in advancing workforce AI technical skills and promoting safe
and responsible AI development. Over the past year, Microsoft
has trained and certified over 23 million people in more than 200
countries in digital skills.129 We also partner with local educational
institutions and invest in organizations like TeachAI and UNESCO
to build the capacity of educators globally.

As our CEO Satya Nadella has said: "Ultimately, our goal is to
democratize AI to enable more people and organizations to
benefit from this powerful technology and help create a more
equitable and inclusive society."130

People and organizations can create their own learning path
using our AI Skills Navigator.131 We have also created curated
learning paths such as Career Essentials in Generative AI, a
LinkedIn Learning course that teaches the skills needed to apply
generative AI in various careers, including core concepts of AI
and generative AI functionality.132


###### Building sustainability fluency

In 2022, Microsoft published Closing the Sustainability Skills Gap,
which highlighted the growing capacity gap in the workforce
that needs to be filled if the world is to meet its sustainability
goals.133 To help close that gap, we have created the Microsoft
Sustainability Skills program to provide educational resources
to equip learners with the necessary skills for jobs in the
environmental sector.134 This program introduces learners to key
sustainability concepts and offers a Career Essentials Certificate
upon completion. In addition, LinkedIn created a Foundations in
Sustainability Course135 and a Sustainability Learning path136 that is
updated regularly with new information and tools development.

In today's world, understanding the implications of Al for
sustainability is a key part of sustainability fluency. For this reason
we have developed a new learning pathway, Career Essentials
in Sustainable Tech,137 which includes a course providing an
introduction to AI and sustainability.138


###### Empowering entrepreneurs and practitioners to use AI for sustainability

Empowering entrepreneurs and practitioners to use AI for
sustainability requires both specialized training in applying
AI to sustainability challenges and fostering communities of
practice. Microsoft has partnered with AI and technology leaders,
along with sustainability experts, to develop targeted training
programs on AI for sustainability. Additionally, we have supported
collaborative networks and innovation hubs to help entrepreneurs
advance scalable sustainability solutions. Here are three examples:

· Al and Climate Change: This publicly available course is part
of the Coursera AI for Good specialization track, which teaches
learners how to combine human and machine intelligence for
positive, real-world sustainability impact.139

· Green Digital Skills Program: This program, developed
in partnership with INCO Academy, includes coursework
ranging from green design principles to AI-driven solutions
for sustainability.140 This includes how AI can be used for
accounting, forecasting, and reducing carbon emissions.

· Kinjani's African Climate Talent Accelerator: Microsoft
has established a strategic partnership with Kinjani's African
Climate Talent Accelerator to empower entrepreneurs and
science-driven innovators.141 This collaboration aims to enhance
skills, expand networks, and provide entrepreneurial and
engineering assistance to develop talent in critical sectors.
The inaugural cohort comprised 29 African founders, 55% of
whom were female, and resulted in 11 new companies being
built. Their focus areas include carbon removal and avoidance
in industries such as food systems, critical minerals, materials,
and urbanization.

###### Looking ahead

The opportunity is clear:
AI can accelerate the transition
to a net-zero, climate-resilient,
and nature-positive world.

However, realizing the full potential
of these capabilities requires not only
advancing AI but also fostering the
conditions for its effective, responsible,
and widespread development and
deployment-spanning investments,
data and infrastructure, resource use
and supply, policies and governance,
and capacity-building.

<!-- PageFooter="Visit microsoft.com/corporate-responsibility to learn more about our journey." -->

Continued investment and innovation are needed across each of
the five plays in our Accelerating Sustainability with A/ playbook.
Each play is a critical role for fully unlocking Al's ability to drive
sustainability progress at unprecedented speed and scale.

Partnerships are central to this vision of innovation and
Microsoft is continuing to collaborate with researchers to
accelerate breakthroughs in sustainability solutions for energy,
agriculture, and many other sectors. We are partnering with
governments and nonprofits to help close data gaps and
build infrastructure to support inclusive AI-enabled solutions.
Collaborations with educational institutions and entrepreneurial
organizations are helping to equip the workforce with the skills
and knowledge needed to use AI for sustainability. These efforts
demonstrate the power of partnership in advancing progress,
though much more remains to be done.

As the new AI economy unfolds, large-scale societal
transformations will reshape industries, economies, and
communities, offering immense potential to drive sustainability
progress through innovation. AI can continue to be a powerful
tool for progress but Al's impact on sustainability will depend
on a range of social, economic, and technological shifts.
This uncertainty underscores the need to develop robust
forecasting scenarios to guide progress. Evidence-based
scenarios offer structured pathways to explore how innovation
for and with Al will influence the global sustainability path-
helping to assess trade-offs, anticipate challenges, and inform
strategic decisions. By aligning efforts and prioritizing actions
based on scenarios that lead to positive outcomes, stakeholders
can ensure that AI innovation accelerates sustainability in
impactful and equitable ways.

By fostering innovation and collaboration, together we can
unlock Al's full potential to create a more resilient, equitable,
and sustainable future.
